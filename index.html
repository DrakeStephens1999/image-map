        <h3 class="center-text underline">Why This Photo?</h3>
        <p class="indent">Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo GameCube, this game shaped my entire highschool
            mind.
            Because of this I have friends, seen the world and received a healthy outlet for competition. For all that
            and
            more I was happy to choose something so special to me to code around. This picture illustrates the top 9
            players
            of 2019. Unfortunately these are the most recent rankings, because as it did for everyone covid got in the
            way.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">The three sections of my map that I chose are as follows: Player’s names, the character that
            they
            play, and the ranking movements from the previous year (red and green column). The player’s names are
            obviously
            important because they worked hard for their names to be on the list. The characters are here in case the
            viewer
            wants to know more about the characters and their advanced techniques. Finally the rankings, I put them here
            in
            case the viewer wanted to see where the players were positioned from the year prior.</p>
        <p class="indent">While anyone visiting this page might not see my passion from the photo. Hopefully my words
            can
            get you excited to interact with it. One of my favorite facts of this photo is that IBDW moved 25 spots up
            in
            one year, that alone shows enough storytelling for any average competition buff to have their interest
            peaked.
            Or half of the characters shown here are foxes, making the outliers that much more exciting. When I heard I
            was
            going to be able to make a image map out of something that interests me. My answer was clear.</p>
